# Basic HTML Website

This is a simple practice website I built to demonstrate basic **HTML** and **CSS** skills.  
It includes multiple pages and stylesheets:

- `index.html` – homepage
- `projects.html` – simple projects page
- `testlabs.html` – test project demo
- `style.css` & `testlabs.css` – styling
- `images/` – image assets

## Live Demo
You can view the site here: [GitHub Pages Link](https://ubaidbuilds.github.io/html-practice/)

## Purpose
This project is **not a portfolio**, but rather a practice project to:
- Show basic understanding of HTML & CSS
- Experiment with linking pages and styling
- Learn how to host a static website using GitHub Pages
